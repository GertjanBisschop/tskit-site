In this video, Wilder Wohns gives examples of how ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs)
stored in `tskit` format have the potential to revolutionise population and statistical
genetics. In particular, inferred tree sequences can be used for inferring geographical
locations of human ancestry, and can be used to improve the speed and accuracy of genetic
association analysis.
