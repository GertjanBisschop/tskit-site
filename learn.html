<h1><a id="what"></a>What is a tree-sequence</h1>
<div>
    <p>A <em>succinct tree sequence</em>, or tree sequence for short, represents the
    relationships between a set of DNA sequences. Tree sequences can be used to store
    genetic data efficiently, and enable powerful and rapid analysis of millions of
    whole genomes at a time. They can be created by
    <a href="software#simulate">simulation</a> or by <a href="software#infer">inferring
    relationships from genetic variation</a>.</p>
    
    The key things a tree sequence can provide are:
    <dl>
        <dt>A record of full genetic ancestry</dt>
        <dd>Tree sequences efficiently store the full genetic history of a set of genomes, by sharing
        <em>edges</em> (branches) between adjacent trees. <a href="#ancestry">Read more ...</a></dd>
        <dt>An encoding of DNA data</dt>
        <dd>Placing mutations on a tree sequence allows lossless representation and compression of
    DNA datasets. <a href="#mutations">Read more ...</a></dd>
        <dt>An efficient analysis framework</dt>
        <dd>Analyses of genetic variation can be reformulated as measurements on trees;
    applying this to trees with shared structure can (massively?) speed up genome-wide statistical calculations. <a href="#analysis">Read more ...</a></dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3 id="ancestry">A record of full genetic ancestry</h3>
    <p>Two basic principles underpin the tree sequence concept:
    <ol>
        <li>At a given position along a chromosome, the relationship between a set of
        genomes can be represented by a single evolutionary tree.</li>
        <li>Trees near to each other on the chromosome look similar, that is they 
        <em>share structure</em>.</li>
    </ol>
    A visualization of a short tree sequence is shown below, focussing on the first 1000
    letters (base pairs) of 20 simulated genomes. These genomes are represented as blue
    dots at the tips of each tree; the position of the trees along the chromosome is
    indicated underneath.
    <figure>

      <figcaption>A tree sequence of the first 1000 base pairs of a
      simulated chromosome. Branches, or <em>edges</em>, shared between trees are highlighted</figcaption>
</figure>
    The relationship, or genealogy, linking the 20 genomes is the same between positions
    0 and 383, and is shown by the first tree. This is slightly different from the genealogy
    between positions 384 and 874 (the second tree), which is again slightly different
    from the genealogy between positions 875 and 999 (the third tree). Nevertheless the
    three trees are almost identical, as highlighted by the shared, coloured branches.</p>
    <p>A tree sequence captures the shared structure between trees by allowing <em>edges</em>
    (the branches or lines in the trees) to persist from one tree to another. This is
    equivalent to storing the difference between adjacent trees. Differences between
    adjacent trees are usually very small, even for huge trees, which explains why tree
    sequences are so efficient.</p>

    <h3 id="mutations">An encoding of DNA data</h3>
    <p>Knowing the full ancestry of all the parts of the genome can be incredibly
    informative, but how does this translate into the actual letters of a DNA sequence?
    The key is that differences between genomes are caused by mutations, and once you
    know the tree, usually only a few mutations are needed to explain the pattern of
    variation.</p>
    <p>This is essentially an <em>evolutionary encoding</em> of the data.</p>
