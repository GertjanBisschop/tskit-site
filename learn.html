<h1><a id="what"></a>What is a tree sequence?</h1>
<div>
    <p>A <em>succinct tree sequence</em>, or tree sequence for short, represents the
    relationships between a set of DNA sequences. Tree sequences can be used to store
    genetic data efficiently, and enable powerful analysis of millions of
    whole genomes at a time. They can be created by
    <a href="software/#simulate">simulation</a> or by <a href="software/#infer">inferring
    relationships from genetic variation</a>.</p>
    
    Tree sequences provide:
    <dl>
        <dt>A record of full genetic ancestry</dt>
        <dd>A tree sequence concisely captures the full history of a set of genomes by sharing
        common branches between adjacent genetic trees. <br/>

        </dd>
        <dt>An encoding of DNA data</dt>
        <dd>Placing mutations on a tree sequence allows lossless representation 
        and compression of DNA datasets. <br/>

        <dt>An efficient analysis framework</dt>
        <dd>Many of the analyses we perform on DNA data can be 
        expressed naturally as operations on the ancestral trees, leading 
        to highly efficient algorithms. <br/>

    <p>If you like learning by example, then head over to the
    <a href="tutorials/">tutorials</a> section of this site, which provides some
    general introductory material, followed by a number of more focussed tutorials
    demonstrating how to generate and process tree sequences.</p>
    
    <p>Tutorials include examples of statistical analysis of simulated genomic data using
    <a href="https://tskit.dev/tskit">tskit</a> as well as advanced usage of genome
    simulation software such as <a href="https://tskit.dev/tskit">msprime</a>.</p>
